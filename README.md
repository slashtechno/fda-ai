# rag-testing  
A learning project for RAG!  

The ideal outcome of this project is to parse 100-200 page PDFs and extract the relevant information. Currently, I'm trying to use [Unstructured](https://docs.unstructured.io/open-source/introduction/overview)'s open source library to parse and partition the PDFs.
