(BICR), including CNS and vertebral or meningeal involvement, or history of distant
metastases.  Exception: pelvic lymph nodes < 2 cm in short axis (N1) located below the
iliac bifurcation are allo wed
Rationale: Inclusion Criterion #5 w as modified to clarify the criteria for eligibility following previous     
anti-androgen treatment to include the 4 week washout period prior to randomization and documented prostate    
specific antigen (PSA) progression.
4.1 Inclusion Criteria;
Inclusion Criterion #5 Patients who received a first generation anti -androgen (e.g., bicalutamide, flutamide, 
nilutamide) must have a 4 -week washout prior to randomization AND must show
continuing disease (PSA) progression (an incr ease in PSA) once they are off the
anti-androgen.
Rationale: Inclusion Criteria #6 to clarify that prior estrogen treatment discontinuation is irrespective of dose
used.
4.1 Inclusion Criteria,
Inclusion Criterion #6At least 4 weeks must have elapsed from the use of 5 -α reductase inhibitors (e.g.,      
dutasteride, finasteride, aminoglutethamide), estrogens (irrespective of dose used), and
any other anti -cancer therapy prior to randomization, including chemotherapy given in
the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting (e.g., clinical trial)
Rationale: Clarified that patients with a history of uncontrolled blood pressure are e ligible if controlled with
anti-hypertensive treatment .
4.2 Exclusion Criteria,
Exclusion Criterion #9Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic BP
≥100 mHg). Patients with a history of uncontrolled hypertension are allowed provided

8.2 Concurrent therap y with any of the following (all must have been
discontinued or substituted for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization):
Medications known to lower the seizure threshold ( for a complete list please see
Appendix 5)

 4. PATIENT  SELECTION
This study can only fulfill its objectives  if appropriate patient s are enrolled.  The following
eligibility criteria are designed to select patients for whom protocol treatment is considered
appropriate.  All relevant medical and non-medical conditions should be taken into
consideration when deciding whether this protocol is suitable for a particular patient.
No waivers will be granted for eligibility criteria deviations.
4.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA
1. Histologically  or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without
neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features, with high risk for development of metastases, defined as PSADT ≤ 10 months
2. Castration -resistant prostate cancer demonstrated during continuous androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT)/post orchiectomy, defined as 3 consecutive rises of PSA, 1 week apart, resulting in two 50% increases over the nadir, with the last PSA
> 2 ng/mL
3. Maintain castrate levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL [1.72 nmol/L]) within 4 weeks of randomization and throughout the study
4. Patients currently receiving bone loss prevention treatment with bone-sparing agents (e.g., bisphosphonates, denosumab [Prolia
